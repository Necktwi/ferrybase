              Extract  a  source package. One non-option argument must be supplied, the name of the Debian source control file (..ddsscc).  An optional second non-option
              argument may be supplied to specify the directory to extract the source package to, this must not exist. If  no  output  directory  is  specified,  the
              source package is extracted into a directory named _s_o_u_r_c_e-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n under the current working directory.

              ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee  will  read the names of the other file(s) making up the source package from the control file; they are assumed to be in the same directory
              as the ..ddsscc.

              The files in the extracted package will have their permissions and ownerships set to those which would have been expected if the files and  directories
              had  simply  been  created - directories and executable files will be 0777 and plain files will be 0666, both modified by the extractors' umask; if the
              parent directory is setgid then the extracted directories will be too, and all the files and directories will inherit its group ownership.

              If the source package uses a non-standard format (currently this means all formats except "1.0"), its name will be stored  in  ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ffoorrmmaatt  so
              that the following builds of the source package use the same format by default.

              Build  a  source package. The first non-option argument is taken as the name of the directory containing the debianized source tree (i.e. with a debian
              sub-directory and maybe changes to the original files).  Depending on the source package format used to build the package, additional parameters  might
              be accepted.

              ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee will build the source package with the first format found in this ordered list: the format indicated with the _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t command line option,
              the format indicated in ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ffoorrmmaatt, "1.0". The fallback to "1.0" is deprecated and will be removed at some point in the  future,  you  should
              always  document  the  desired  source  format  in ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ffoorrmmaatt. See section SSOOUURRCCEE PPAACCKKAAGGEE FFOORRMMAATTSS for an extensive description of the various

              command is idempotent and can be called multiple times. Not all source formats implement something in this hook, and those that do usually  use  it  to

       --TT_s_u_b_s_t_v_a_r_s_-_f_i_l_e

              You  may  specify  a  perl regular expression to match files you want filtered out of the list of files for the diff. (This list is generated by a find
              command.) (If the source package is being built as a version 3 source package using a VCS, this can be used to ignore uncommited  changes  on  specific
              files. Using -i.* will ignore all of them.)

              The  --ii  option  by  itself  enables  this  setting  with  a  default regex (preserving any modification to the default regex done by a previous use of
              ----eexxtteenndd--ddiiffff--iiggnnoorree) that will filter out control files and directories of the most common revision control systems, backup and swap files and Libtool
              build output directories. There can only be one active regex, of multiple --ii options only the last one will take effect.

              This  is  very helpful in cutting out extraneous files that get included in the diff, e.g. if you maintain your source in a revision control system and
              want to use a checkout to build a source package without including the additional files and directories  that  it  will  usually  contain  (e.g.  CVS/,
              .cvsignore, .svn/). The default regex is already very exhaustive, but if you need to replace it, please note that by default it can match any part of a
              path, so if you want to match the begin of a filename or only full filenames, you will need to provide the necessary anchors  (e.g.  '(^|/)',  '($|/)')
              yourself.

       ----eexxtteenndd--ddiiffff--iiggnnoorree=_r_e_g_e_x
              The perl regular expression specified will extend the default value used by ----ddiiffff--iiggnnoorree and its current value (if set). It does this by concatenating
              "||_r_e_g_e_x" to the existing value.  This option is convenient to use in ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ooppttiioonnss to exclude some  auto-generated  files  from  the  automatic
              patch generation.

       --II[_f_i_l_e_-_p_a_t_t_e_r_n], ----ttaarr--iiggnnoorree[=_f_i_l_e_-_p_a_t_t_e_r_n]
              If  this option is specified, the pattern will be passed to ttaarr(1)'s ----eexxcclluuddee option when it is called to generate a .orig.tar or .tar file. For exam‐
              ple, --IICVS will make tar skip over CVS directories when generating a .tar.gz file. The option may be repeated multiple times to list multiple  patterns
              to exclude.

              --II  by itself adds default ----eexxcclluuddee options that will filter out control files and directories of the most common revision control systems, backup and
              swap files and Libtool build output directories.

       NNoottee:: While they have similar purposes, --ii and --II have very different syntax and semantics. --ii can only be specified once and takes a perl compatible  regular
       expression  which  is  matched against the full relative path of each file. --II can specified multiple times and takes a filename pattern with shell wildcards.
       The pattern is applied to the full relative path but also to each part of the path individually. The exact semantic of tar's ----eexxcclluuddee option is somewhat com‐
       plicated, see https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#wildcards for a full documentation.

       The default regex and patterns for both options can be seen in the output of the ----hheellpp command.

       If  you  don't know what source format to use, you should probably pick either "3.0 (quilt)" or "3.0 (native)". See https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0
       for information on the deployment of those formats within Debian.


   FFoorrmmaatt:: 11..00
       A source package in this format consists either of a ..oorriigg..ttaarr..ggzz associated to a ..ddiiffff..ggzz or a single ..ttaarr..ggzz (in  that  case  the  package  is  said  to  be
       _n_a_t_i_v_e).

       EExxttrraaccttiinngg

       Extracting  a  native package is a simple extraction of the single tarball in the target directory. Extracting a non-native package is done by first unpacking
       the ..oorriigg..ttaarr..ggzz and then applying the patch contained in the ..ddiiffff..ggzz file. The timestamp of all patched files is reset to the extraction time of the  source
       package  (this  avoids timestamp skews leading to problems when autogenerated files are patched). The diff can create new files (the whole debian directory is
       created that way) but can't remove files (empty files will be left over).

       BBuuiillddiinngg

       Building a native package is just creating a single tarball with the source directory. Building a non-native package involves extracting the original  tarball
       in a separate ".orig" directory and regenerating the ..ddiiffff..ggzz by comparing the source package _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y with the .orig directory.

       BBuuiilldd ooppttiioonnss ((wwiitthh --bb))::

       If  a second non-option argument is supplied it should be the name of the original source directory or tarfile or the empty string if the package is a Debian-
       specific one and so has no Debianisation diffs. If no second argument is supplied then ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee will look for the original source tarfile _p_a_c_k_a_g_e___u_p_s_t_r_e_a_m_-
       _v_e_r_s_i_o_n..oorriigg..ttaarr..ggzz or the original source directory _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y..oorriigg depending on the --ssXX arguments.

       --ssaa, --sspp, --sskk, --ssuu and --ssrr will not overwrite existing tarfiles or directories. If this is desired then --ssAA, --ssPP, --ssKK, --ssUU and --ssRR should be used instead.

       --sskk    Specifies  to  expect  the original source as a tarfile, by default _p_a_c_k_a_g_e___u_p_s_t_r_e_a_m_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n..oorriigg..ttaarr.._e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n.  It will leave this original source in
              place as a tarfile, or copy it to the current directory if it isn't already there. The tarball will be unpacked into _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y..oorriigg for the  generation
              of the diff.

       --sspp    Like --sskk but will remove the directory again afterwards.

       --ssuu    Specifies  that  the  original  source  is expected as a directory, by default _p_a_c_k_a_g_e--_u_p_s_t_r_e_a_m_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n..oorriigg and ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee will create a new original
              source archive from it.

       --ssrr    Like --ssuu but will remove that directory after it has been used.

       --ssss    Specifies that the original source is available both as a directory and as a tarfile. ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee will use the directory to create the  diff,  but  the
              tarfile to create the ..ddsscc.  This option must be used with care - if the directory and tarfile do not match a bad source archive will be generated.

       --ssnn    Specifies  to  not  look for any original source, and to not generate a diff.  The second argument, if supplied, must be the empty string. This is used
              for Debian-specific packages which do not have a separate upstream source and therefore have no debianisation diffs.

       --ssaa or --ssAA
              Specifies to look for the original source archive as a tarfile or as a directory - the second argument, if any, may be  either,  or  the  empty  string
              (this is equivalent to using --ssnn).  If a tarfile is found it will unpack it to create the diff and remove it afterwards (this is equivalent to --sspp); if
              a directory is found it will pack it to create the original source and remove it afterwards (this is equivalent to --ssrr); if neither is  found  it  will

   FFoorrmmaatt:: 22..00
       Also known as wig&pen. This format is not recommended for wide-spread usage, the format "3.0 (quilt)" replaces it. Wig&pen was the first  specification  of  a
       new-generation source package format.

       The  behaviour  of  this  format  is the same as the "3.0 (quilt)" format except that it doesn't use an explicit list of patches. All files in ddeebbiiaann//ppaattcchheess//
       matching the perl regular expression [[\\ww--]]++ must be valid patches: they are applied at extraction time.

       When building a new source package, any change to the upstream source is stored in a patch named zzzz__ddeebbiiaann--ddiiffff--aauuttoo.

   FFoorrmmaatt:: 33..00 ((nnaattiivvee))
       This format is an extension of the native package format as defined in the 1.0 format. It supports all compression methods and will ignore by default any  VCS
       specific files and directories as well as many temporary files (see default value associated to --II option in the ----hheellpp output).

   FFoorrmmaatt:: 33..00 ((qquuiilltt))
       A  source  package  in  this  format  contains  at  least  an  original  tarball  (..oorriigg..ttaarr.._e_x_t  where  _e_x_t can be ggzz, bbzz22, llzzmmaa and xxzz) and a debian tarball
       (..ddeebbiiaann..ttaarr.._e_x_t). It can also contain additional original tarballs (..oorriigg--_c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t..ttaarr.._e_x_t).  _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t can only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens
       ("-").

       EExxttrraaccttiinngg

       The  main  original  tarball is extracted first, then all additional original tarballs are extracted in subdirectories named after the _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t part of their
       filename (any pre-existing directory is replaced). The debian tarball is extracted on top of the source directory after  prior  removal  of  any  pre-existing
       ddeebbiiaann  directory.  Note  that  the  debian  tarball  must  contain a ddeebbiiaann sub-directory but it can also contain binary files outside of that directory (see
       ----iinncclluuddee--bbiinnaarriieess option).

       All patches listed in ddeebbiiaann//ppaattcchheess//ddeebbiiaann..sseerriieess or ddeebbiiaann//ppaattcchheess//sseerriieess are then applied.  If the former file is used and the latter one doesn't exist (or
       is  a  symlink), then the latter is replaced with a symlink to the former. This is meant to simplify usage of qquuiilltt to manage the set of patches. Note however
       that while ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee parses correctly series files with explicit options used for patch application (stored on each line after the patch filename and one or
       more  spaces),  it  does  ignore those options and always expect patches that can be applied with the --pp11 option of ppaattcchh. It will thus emit a warning when it
       encounters such options, and the build is likely to fail.

       Contrary to qquuiilltt's default behaviour, patches are expected to apply without any fuzz. When that is not the case, you should refresh such patches with  qquuiilltt,
       or ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee will error out while trying to apply them.

       Similarly to qquuiilltt's default behaviour, the patches can remove files too.

       The file ..ppcc//aapppplliieedd--ppaattcchheess is created if some patches have been applied during the extraction.

       BBuuiillddiinngg

       All  original  tarballs found in the current directory are extracted in a temporary directory by following the same logic as for the unpack, the debian direc‐
       tory is copied over in the temporary directory, and all patches except the automatic patch (ddeebbiiaann--cchhaannggeess--_v_e_r_s_i_o_n  or  ddeebbiiaann--cchhaannggeess,  depending  on  ----ssiinn‐‐
       ggllee--ddeebbiiaann--ppaattcchh)  are applied. The temporary directory is compared to the source package directory. When the diff is non-empty, the build fails unless ----ssiinn‐‐
       ggllee--ddeebbiiaann--ppaattcchh or ----aauuttoo--ccoommmmiitt has been used, in which case the diff is stored in the automatic patch.  If the automatic  patch  is  created/deleted,  it's
       added/removed from the series file and from the qquuiilltt metadata.

       Any change on a binary file is not representable in a diff and will thus lead to a failure unless the maintainer deliberately decided to include that modified
       binary file in the debian tarball (by listing it in ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//iinncclluuddee--bbiinnaarriieess). The build will also fail if it finds binary  files  in  the  debian  sub-
       directory unless they have been whitelisted through ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//iinncclluuddee--bbiinnaarriieess.

       The updated debian directory and the list of modified binaries is then used to generate the debian tarball.

       The  automatically  generated diff doesn't include changes on VCS specific files as well as many temporary files (see default value associated to --ii option in
       the ----hheellpp output). In particular, the ..ppcc directory used by qquuiilltt is ignored during generation of the automatic patch.

       Note: ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee ----bbeeffoorree--bbuuiilldd (and --bb) will ensure that all patches listed in the series file are applied so that a package build always  has  all  patches
       applied. It does this by finding unapplied patches (they are listed in the sseerriieess file but not in ..ppcc//aapppplliieedd--ppaattcchheess), and if the first patch in that set can
       be applied without errors, it will apply them all. The option ----nnoo--pprreeppaarraattiioonn can be used to disable this behavior.

              Generates a patch corresponding to the local changes that are not managed by the qquuiilltt patch system and integrates it in the  patch  system  under  the
              name  _p_a_t_c_h_-_n_a_m_e.  If  the  name is missing, it will be asked interactively. If _p_a_t_c_h_-_f_i_l_e is given, it is used as the patch corresponding to the local
              changes to integrate. Once integrated, an editor is launched so that you can edit the meta-information in the patch header.

              Passing _p_a_t_c_h_-_f_i_l_e is mainly useful after a build failure that pre-generated this file, and on this ground the given file is removed after integration.
              Note  also that the changes contained in the patch file must already be applied on the tree and that the files modified by the patch must not have sup‐
              plementary unrecorded changes.

              If the patch generation detects modified binary files, they will be automatically added to ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//iinncclluuddee--bbiinnaarriieess so that they end  up  in  the

       The bundle is cloned as a git repository to the target directory.  If there is a gitshallow file, it is installed as  `.git/shallow`  inside  the  cloned  git

       The file ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ffoorrmmaatt should always exist and indicate the desired source format. For backwards compatibility, format "1.0" is assumed when  the  file
       doesn't exist but you should not rely on this: at some point in the future ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee will be modified to fail when that file doesn't exist.

       The  rationale  is that format "1.0" is no longer the recommended format, you should usually pick one of the newer formats ("3.0 (quilt)", "3.0 (native)") but
       ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee will not do this automatically for you.  If you want to continue using the old  format,  you  should  be  explicit  about  it  and  put  "1.0"  in
       ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ffoorrmmaatt.

       When using source format "1.0" it is usually a bad idea to modify upstream files directly as the changes end up hidden and mostly undocumented in the .diff.gz
       file. Instead you should store your changes as patches in the debian directory and apply them at build-time. To avoid this complexity you  can  also  use  the
       format "3.0 (quilt)" that offers this natively.

       Changes to upstream sources are usually stored with patch files, but not all changes can be represented with patches: they can only alter the content of plain
       text files. If you try replacing a file with something of a different type (for example replacing a plain file with a symlink or a directory),  you  will  get
       this error message.

       Empty files can't be created with patch files. Thus this change is not recorded in the source package and you are warned about it.

       Patch files do not record permissions of files and thus executable permissions are not stored in the source package. This warning reminds you of that fact.

       This  file contains on a single line the format that should be used to build the source package (possible formats are described above). No leading or trailing
       spaces are allowed.

       This file contains a list of binary files (one per line) that should be included in the debian tarball. Leading  and  trailing  spaces  are  stripped.   Lines
       starting with "#" are comments and are skipped. Empty lines are ignored.

   ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ooppttiioonnss
       This  file  contains  a  list  of  long  options  that should be automatically prepended to the set of command line options of a ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee --bb or ddppkkgg--ssoouurrccee
       ----pprriinntt--ffoorrmmaatt call. Options like ----ccoommpprreessssiioonn and ----ccoommpprreessssiioonn--lleevveell are well suited for this file.

       Each option should be put on a separate line. Empty lines and lines starting with "#" are ignored. The leading "--" should be stripped and short  options  are
       not allowed. Optional spaces are allowed around the "=" symbol and optional quotes are allowed around the value.  Here's an example of such a file:

         # let dpkg-source create a debian.tar.bz2 with maximal compression
         compression = "bzip2"
         compression-level = 9
         # use debian/patches/debian-changes as automatic patch
         single-debian-patch
         # ignore changes on config.{sub,guess}
         extend-diff-ignore = "(^|/)(config.sub|config.guess)$"

       Note: ffoorrmmaatt options are not accepted in this file, you should use ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ffoorrmmaatt instead.

       Exactly  like  ddeebbiiaann//ssoouurrccee//ooppttiioonnss  except that the file is not included in the generated source package. It can be useful to store a preference tied to the
       maintainer or to the VCS repository where the source package is maintained.

       This  file  lists  all  patches  that have to be applied (in the given order) on top of the upstream source package. Leading and trailing spaces are stripped.
       Lines starting with "#" are comments and are skipped. Empty lines are ignored. Remaining lines start with a patch filename (relative  to  the  ddeebbiiaann//ppaattcchheess//
       directory)  up  to  the  first space character or the end of line. Optional qquuiilltt options can follow up to the end of line or the first "#" preceded by one or
       more spaces (which marks the start of a comment up to the end of line).

       The point at which field overriding occurs compared to certain standard output field settings is rather confused.
